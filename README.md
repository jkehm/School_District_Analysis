# School_District_Analysis

### Background
Maria has gotten a new version of the student data with several changes. This includes an additional column: "school budget". She wants you to rework part of your analysis by using the new dataset.
### Deliverables
* Deliverable 1: Collect the student data into a DataFrame
* Deliverable 2: Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
* Deliverable 3: Summarize key pieces of the data.
* Deliverable 4: Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.
* Deliverable 5: Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.
* Deliverable 6: A written analysis of your results (README.md).

### Resources
* Software: Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas
* DataSource: new_full_student_data.csv 

### The Code
A link to the code can be found [here] (https://github.com/jkehm/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Starter_Code/Unsolved/Student_Data_Challenge_Starter_Code.ipynb)

### Results
The main discovery that I made is that, despite having a lower budget (seen in delivery 5.1), the charter schools have better grades in math on average. If I was the schoolboard, I would look at what the charter schools are doing differently than the public schools. From there the budgets could be used more effiecently, and give the students a greater chance of success. 

Another piece of analysis that could be added is for reading scores when comparing the school type and grades. This way, we can get a more complete picture of the overall performance of the school types, and not just the performance in math.
